# BraidMaker
##Background
A program that draws braids given a braid word. This program was originally designed to allow users to draw and manipulate knots and links in SnapPy: https://snappy.math.uic.edu/ and the draw them into KLO: https://community.middlebury.edu/~mathanimations/klo/ since KLO currently does not seem to support loading SnapPy files.

This program was created during my UCARE thesis project at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Please support the program! You can read about it here: https://ucare.unl.edu/

##I'd like to request a feature!
Feel free to make an issue, a pull request, or send me a direct message. No guareentee I will get to your feature in any timely manner (or at all). Right now I am committed to working on my thesis project, so if your feature request doesn't help me with my thesis is will be very low priority. You're welcome to implement your own features and make pull requests though! And if you don't know how to code, getting starting working with python is relatively easy: https://www.w3schools.com/python/
